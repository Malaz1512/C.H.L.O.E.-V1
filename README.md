**Model Not Downloading?**

* Ensure your internet connection is active on first run (for downloading models).
* On Linux: If you get permission issues, try running with `sudo` or fixing permissions for `.ollama`.

**No Response from Chloe?**

* Make sure the Ollama server is running (`ollama serve`).
* If still stuck, restart both Ollama and Chloe, and check for errors in the terminal.
* If stuck after both steps, maybe LLM model is too large for your computer, switch to the small models and see if it is still stays stuck.
